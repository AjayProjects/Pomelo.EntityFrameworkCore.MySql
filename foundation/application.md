<!-- 
Instructions:
Thanks for your application to join the .NET Foundation. 

1.  Here is a checklist of steps we’ll follow during the process: [https://github.com/dotnet/foundation/blob/master/guidance/new-projects.md](https://github.com/dotnet/foundation/blob/master/guidance/new-projects.md)
2.  Please fill out the application in the template below. If you prefer to submit via e-mail to keep information private, you can use this [application form](https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/projects/blob/master/OnBoardingQuestionaire.docx) and submit to contact@dotnetfoundation.org, referencing this issue number. You can also fill out the Word document and submit it as an [attachement to the issue](https://help.github.com/en/articles/file-attachments-on-issues-and-pull-requests), via Google Doc, etc. If you have questions, fill out what you know and discuss on the issue.
3.  After review and comment by the advisory council, we will submit your questionnaire to the board of directors recommending we add your project.
4.  We will send you a contribution agreement via DocuSign.
5.  We can announce the project is joining, and work through the other steps on the checklist.


Some common questions that come up on the questionnaire:

*   Project Transfer Signatories section: List the top contributors, with contact e-mail. For most projects, this is the top 1-5 contributors who have contributed more than a few hundred lines of code.
*   Contribution vs Assignment: The difference is in the contribution model is who actually owns the copyright. It is important, but in terms of practical operation of the project it’s pretty transparent.


*   **Contribution:** The project grants the .NET Foundation a license and rights to the intellectual property and source code. The project agrees that it is their work, and the .NET Foundation can protect your copyright.
*   **Assignment:** The project / company gives the .NET Foundation the project, the .NET Foundation grants it back  

 Normally for community projects we recommend contribution. It’s more applicable for projects that have had multiple contributors over a period of time. Assignment is more applicable for a project that was developed in-house by a company, as they have had complete and traceable ownership of the project throughout its lifespan. Either works fine and has little to no day to day impact on the project once it joins from an actual open source development / shipping software point of view. I’d honestly have to go back and check the transfer agreements for a project to tell you what contribution model they chose. So, whatever makes your lawyers happiest is best.

## 1.   General Information

**Project Name:**

**License:**

**Contributor (Company, Organization or individual name(s)):**

**Existing OSS Project? (Yes/No):**

**Source Code URL:**

**Project Homepage URL (if different):**

**Project Transfer Signatories:**
Full legal name and email address required of the individual(s) with the authority to transfer or contribute the project to the .NET Foundation. Note that if you'd prefer not to include this in the public application, it can be submitted via e-mail to contact@dotnetfoundation.org (referencing this issue number).

## 2.   Description
**Please provide a brief statement about your project in terms that are understandable to the target consumer of the library or project, i.e. an elevator pitch for the project:**


**Please provide a 1 sentence (<140 character) summary of your to help users when searching the .NET Foundation projects**

## 3.   Project Governance
Please complete this section about who will be maintaining the open source project and how it will run.
**Project Lead:**
(Who is the primary contact point for the community and the .NET Foundation when discussing governance of the project.)

Name:   
 Email:   
 GitHub Profile URL:

**Committers:**

Which individuals have commit / write access to the repository, what is their GitHub ID and who is their employer (if contributions are on behalf of an employer)

**Governance Model:**

Please describe how new code changes are proposed to the project, how those changes are reviewed and how a decision is made to accept proposed changes. Also describe the process for identifying and appointing new committers.

**CLA**

If already an OSS project, was a Contribution License Agreement in place for contributions accepted? How does the project check who has signed one?

**CLA Notification Alias**
Provide an email address that will receive CLA related notifications from the .NET Foundation CLA automation

**Project Transfer Type**

Projects may join the .NET Foundation in one of two ways and you should chat with your .NET Foundation contact to discuss the best mechanism for your project. You can either a) assign the copyright of the project's source code to the .NET Foundation or b) contribute the project source code to the .NET Foundation under an open source license. Assignment is the preferred approach, but licensing a project to the Foundation may be more appropriate for longer running open source projects that have not previously had a contribution license agreement and have accepted contributions from many different sources.
a) Assignment
b) Contribution


## 4.   Repository Layout
The .NET Foundation host guidance for new projects and details on recommended structure here:
[https://github.com/dotnet/home/tree/master/guidance](https://github.com/dotnet/home/tree/master/guidance)

Note that the open source repository should be the master where changes are made by the core development team using the same PR process that is used for non-committer contributions.

Please define below any changes you would want to make to your repositories as part of the process of joining the .NET Foundation

## 5.   PR Plan
Please summarize the public relations plan for the announcement when joining the foundation (and releasing as open source if appropriate). What is the main story we wish to promote, through what channels, what issues should we be aware of?  For significant news events then please also work with your .NET Foundation contact to ensure a [full PR plan](https://dotnetfoundation.sharepoint.com/Shared%20Documents/PR/Communications%20Plan%20TEMPLATE.docx?web=1) is developed.

## 6.   Infrastructure Requirements
Please describe any infrastructure requirements for the project. For example, how will build servers be operated? Any web hosting or service hosting requirements? Do we need to set up SSL certificates or provide Authenticode Code Signing arrangement for releases?


## 7.   Additional Notes
Please provide any additional information required or use this area for notes during the onboarding process. If this open source project has similarities with any other projects in this space then please detail them and why this project is different. If there are any potential issues that you feel the project might need help with early on then also state them here and discuss with your .NET Foundation Contact.
